This is the code repository for Two Watts is All You Need: Enabling In-Detector Real-Time Machine Learning for Neutrino Telescopes Via Edge Computing

Currently, you can find all the plots and the scripts to make them (as well as the data) in directory paper_plots; you can find the network architecture, training script, and (hyper-)parameter settings in the directory v2_smallnet.

More detailed documentation is on the way. A link to the data simulation will also be put on here momentarily. For now, please contact Miaochen Jin (email found in manuscript) for any question. We are willing to discuss and share any data upon requests.
